# Object-Detection-YOLO

- This repo aims to implement object detection for food (in the future, so far is for car detection).

- Please download pre-trained yolo weights from http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights.

- `UNIMIB2016-annotations` contains the .mat file of annotations and a matlab file to load and analyze the annotations from [UNIMIB2016](http://www.ivl.disco.unimib.it/activities/food-recognition/). It is a dataset for real canteen tray with dishes and foods arragned in different ways. I put the matlab result in the `data_js.csv` file.
