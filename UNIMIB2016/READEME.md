## UNIMIB2016
- This folder contains useful annotations and image information extraction code.
- `all_data_info.csv` contains all the information extracted by using matlab which loaded
  the original .mat file from UNIMIB2016 offical website.
    - Each entry in the map corresponds to the annotations of an image.
    - Each entry contains many cell tuples as annotated food
    - A tuple is composed of 8 cells with the annotated:
    - (1) item category (food for all tuples)
    - (2) item class (e.g. pasta, patate, ...)
    - (3) item name
    - (4) boundary type (polygonal for all tuples)
    - (5) item's boundary points [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn]
    - (6) item's bounding box [x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4]
- `useful_data_info.csv` contains only useful information of images in order to generate npz file.
- `annotations.mat` is downloaded from UNIMIB2016 website.
- `annotations2csv.m` is a matlab file which used to load 'annotations.mat' and save the information
  to `all_data_info.csv` for each object in every image.
- `demo.m` is a matlab file downloaded from UNIMIB2016 website, which could display
  box boundaries, polygen boundaries, class names, etc for each pic one by one.
- `statistics_cell.txt` contains all the 73 class names along with how many times they appear in the images.
- `unimib2016-js.npz` is the npz file used to retrain the yolov2 model for food detection,
  generated by `image_info_process.py`.
